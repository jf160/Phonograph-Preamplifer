# Phonograph-Preamplifer
This project was completed for Electronics Lab (ECE 3155) at the University of Houston Fall 2020. This project had us build and analyze the phono-preampifier, which is a device commonly seen in record players. It takes an input from the vinyl disc, applies the RIAA filter, and then boosts the signal before it sends it out to a standard sound system. This project had us build a preamp design by Rod Elliot and analyze it using a waveform generator, oscilloscope, and spectrum analyzer. We also had to change some capacitor values to get a better lookimg transfer function. The whole project can be seen in the .pdf file, which also includes our sources. This project was a collaboration by Justin Francisco, Christian Arreola, Toan Pham, Jorge Martinez, and Lucas Cardenas.
